Breaking into Data Science and Machine Learning–New Data Scientist’s Journey

In this article, I give an account on how Students around the world break into the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. The story is based on data collected from 5253 students that took part in the survey “Kaggle Data Science Survey 2018 for Machine Learning and Data Science Community”.  
Data Science (DS) and Machine learning (ML) have revolutionized the way we do business today, and a lot is still being explored to date. AI is driving the 21st innovations and the fact that ML as a field in AI needs well prepared Data for training–of course this Data is a product of Data Science. This places ML & DS among the top hot fascinating fields that students all over the world yearn to break into.
Now, who are the students breaking into DS & ML and where are they located? , which tools do they use?  , what’s their education background? , how much time do they devote to learning DS & ML and how do they learn? , what challenges them? , how about the programming languages they opt for? , and lastly which kind of data do they interact with and what are their main sources for data/information?. These are some of the questions I answer basing on the information provided by survey takers (students) in Kaggle Data Science Survey 2018 for Machine Learning and Data Science Community

Who And Where They Are Residing?
I answer the “who?” by looking at the age brackets for kaggers and the “where?” is their current country of residence. According to the survey, majority of new data scientists are aged 18-21 and currently residing in India, USA, and China respectively. It is also evident that the numbers gradually decrease as age range increases–for example above 40, we see less than 10 new aspiring data scientists.

Which Tools Do They Use?
To break into data science and become a super data scientist, in other words gain expertise in DS & ML field is really challenging, and requires unstoppable commitment to finally achieve the dream. Here I’m going to present the tools in terms of  integrated development environments (IDE's) , hosted notebooks, cloud computing services,  programming languages, machine learning frameworks, ML libraries, and data visualization libraries  students use most often on their journey to becoming super data scientist.
