In repository through *data visualization*, gives an account on how Students around the world *break into the field of Data Science and Machine Learning*. The story is based on data collected from *5253 students* that took part in the survey *“Kaggle Data Science Survey 2018 for Machine Learning and Data Science Community”*.  
**Data Science (DS)** and **Machine learning (ML)** have revolutionized the way we do business today, and a lot is still being explored to date. AI is driving the 21st innovations and the fact that ML as a field in AI needs well prepared Data for training–of course this Data is a product of Data Science. This places ML & DS among the top hot fascinating fields that students all over the world yearn to break into.

**Using this repo will, you will know... **, *who are the students breaking into DS & ML and where are they located?* , *which tools do they use? * , *what’s their education background?* , *how much time do they devote to learning DS & ML and how do they learn? , what challenges them? *, *how about the programming languages they opt for? *, and lastly *which kind of data do they interact with and what are their main sources for data/information?*. 

**Who And Where They Are Residing?**

The “who?” looks at the age brackets for kaggers and the “where?” is their current country of residence. *According to the survey*, majority of new data scientists are *aged 18-21* and currently residing in **India**, **USA**, and **China** respectively. It is also evident that the numbers gradually decrease as age range increases–for example above 40, we see less than 10 new aspiring data scientists.

**Which Tools Do They Use?**

To *break into data science* and become a *super data scientist*, in other words gain expertise in DS & ML field is really challenging, and requires *unstoppable commitment* to finally achieve the dream. **tool_they_opt_for.py** presents the tools in terms of  *integrated development environments (IDE's)* , *hosted notebooks*, *cloud computing services*,  *programming languages*, *machine learning frameworks*, *ML libraries*, and *data visualization libraries*  students use most often on their journey to becoming super data scientist.
